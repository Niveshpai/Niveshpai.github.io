### Please check contributing.md and follow the guidelines if you want to make changes. The PR will be reviewed within 4-6 days, since I am quite busy right now. :/
    
### Also, I am shipping out some stickers(and possibly a t-shirt) if you make a major contribution to the website. :) [p.s: There maybe some delay in shipping or if the shipping expenses are high, you may need to bear it.(in rare cases)]

    Major contributions involve(but not limited to) :
    1. Revamping and stylising to a major extent while maintaining the original feel of the website.
    2. Fixing and/or implementing new features which can extensively help the user.
    3. Fixing severe and critical security bugs. [This may/may not be applicable since no backend is used.]
    4. Something unique and praise-worthy which is not within the above scope.
